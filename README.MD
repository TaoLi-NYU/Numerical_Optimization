# Numerical Optimization
This repo is created for the course "Advanced Topics: Numerical Optimization", which includes numerical optimzation algorithms 
introduced in this course, such as simplex method in linear programming, Trust region and line search in nonlinear optimzation.
Currently, there are simplex method as well as one dimensional zero finding algorithms and once the course is finished, a more 
comprehesive table of contents will be provided here. Notice that the materials also cover some assignments related prigramms 
and will be updated all the time.
## Table of contents
